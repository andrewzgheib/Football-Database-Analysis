## Overview
This project is aimed at creating a comprehensive football database structure using PostgreSQL and visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) using Microsoft PowerBI. The database encompasses various aspects of football data, including player statistics, match details, team information, and more.

## Approach
- **Database Structure**: A relational database structure developed from scratch to store football-related data efficiently.
- **Data Collection and Cleaning**: Collected data from various sources on the internet and performed data cleaning using the Pandas library to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
- **Query Development**: Generated multiple pgSQL queries to create tables, populate them with data, and extract meaningful KPIs.
- **Visualization**: Utilized Microsoft PowerBI to create interactive visualizations of the extracted KPIs, providing intuitive insights into football performance metrics.

## Technologies Used
- **PostgreSQL**: Used as the primary database management system to store and manage football-related data.
- **Pandas**: Used for data cleaning.
- **Microsoft PowerBI**: Employed for data visualization and creating interactive dashboards to showcase key performance indicators.

## Database Schema
Please refer to [Documentation.html]() for a detailed look at the schema

## Getting Started
1. Install and setup [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) on your local machine.
2. Execute [schema.sql]() to create the necessary tables.
3. Optionally, you can run [data.sql]() to populate the dataset with sample data.
