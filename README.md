## Overview
This project is aimed at creating a comprehensive football database structure using PostgreSQL and visualizing KPIs using Microsoft PowerBI. The database encompasses various aspects of football data, including player statistics, match details, team information, and much more.

## Approach
- **Database Structure**: A relational database structure developed from scratch to store football-related data efficiently.
- **Data Collection and Cleaning**: Collected data from various sources on the internet and performed data cleaning using the Pandas library to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
- **Query Development**: Generated multiple pgSQL queries to create tables, populate them with data, and extract meaningful KPIs.
- **Visualization**: Utilized Microsoft PowerBI to create interactive visualizations of the extracted KPIs, providing intuitive insights into football performance metrics.

## Technologies Used
- **Database Management**: PostgreSQL
- **Data Cleaning**: Pandas module
- **Data Visualization**: Microsoft PowerBI

## Database Schema
You can take a look at the [schema](https://github.com/andrewzgheib/Football-Database-Analysis/blob/main/image.png), or if you wish of a more a detailed look, refer to the [Documentation.html](https://github.com/andrewzgheib/Football-Database-Analysis/blob/main/Documentation.html) file.

## Getting Started
1. Install and setup [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) on your local machine.
2. Execute [schema.sql](https://github.com/andrewzgheib/Football-Database-Analysis/blob/main/schema.sql) to create the necessary tables.
3. Optionally, you can run [data.sql](https://github.com/andrewzgheib/Football-Database-Analysis/blob/main/data.sql) to populate the dataset with sample data.
